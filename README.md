# php_disqus

small demo to access disqus data via the disqus api and php

design attempts to utilize approaches like
- test driven design (simple custom assert class)
- functional programming (going immutable where plausible)
- separation of concerns (focused classes)
- dry

currently only handles simple api parameter types
