# php_disqus

small demo to access disqus data via the disqus api and php

design attempts to utilize approaches like
- test driven design (simple custom assert class)
- functional programming (going immutable where plausible)
- separation of concerns (focused classes)
- dry

currently only handles simple api parameter types and a very small set of endpoints


to build, add a private.php file to the root folder and add your disqus keys
define('API_SECRET', '<your secret here>');
define('API_KEY', '<your key here>');
define('ACCESS_TOKEN', '<a testing token here>')
